Over the course of my career, I’ve carried a broad set of titles: VP of Product, Director of Technical Product Management, Senior Product Manager, Product Designer, UI Designer, Front-End Engineer, Software Engineer — and I’ve probably worn a few more hats that don’t fit neatly on a LinkedIn profile.

Along the way, there have been a ton of lessons. Some from success, many from mistakes, most through trial and error. But what’s propelled me throughout has always been a deep curiosity — a drive to understand, to experiment, and to keep growing even when the path wasn’t clear.

Until now, most of what I’ve learned lived quietly in private notes, peer conversations, or embedded in the products I helped build. While I’m an ardent second-brain note-taker, I’ve lately felt a pull toward using a blog format — a space where I’m pushed to sharpen what I’m writing about, share more vulnerably, and give back, considering how much I’ve benefited from the ideas and work of others.

To that end, I intend for this to be less of a polished publication and more of a working collection of ideas, experiments, frameworks, and lessons learned — shared as they’re being explored. Some might call it a digital garden; I think of it more as my digital workbench.

Recently, my curiosity has turned especially technical, diving deep into areas like AI, automation, and system design. I’ve been hands-on with the modern AI and automation stack, exploring opportunities around personal productivity and rapid prototyping. But I’m equally eager to write about all the disciplines that have shaped my journey — from building better products, to designing better experiences, to leading stronger teams.

If you’re a product manager, designer, engineer, founder, or simply curious, I hope you’ll find something here that sparks a thought or helps you learn something new.
